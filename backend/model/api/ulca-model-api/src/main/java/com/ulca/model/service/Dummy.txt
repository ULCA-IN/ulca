If number of tasks == 1
    Keep source and target languages of the one task only

prev_target_languages = [en,hi] #Of ASR
If number of tasks > 1:
next_task_index = 1
final_task_index = 2
For each target language of first task: 

    while(next_task_index<=final_task_index):
        #en in ASR
        #populate the queue with next_task source and target languages
        If queue is empty
            get the languages of next task [next_task_index = 1] => get tasks of Translation and store in queue.
            While storing in queue, check prev_target_languages
            increase next_task_index

        #populate the queue with only source languages of tne next task and remove current_task details
        #[[en-hi],[en-ta],[en-te],[hi-ta],[hi-te],[hi-mr]]
        size = queue.size()
        For each element in queue (until you reach the size):
            pop the element
            check if the source language matches "en"
            If it matches, store target language in prev_target_languages queue
